# Motor Collision Toronto

## Overview

The papers in this repository investigate motor vehicle collisions resulting in injuries and fatalities in the City of Toronto from 2006 to 2022. By exploring the trends in these traffic collisions in terms of district, environmental condition, visibility, and light condition, I find that there is no significant association between inclement weather and collision risk. Consideration should be given to the fact that improving roadway infrastructure, enhancing education for new drivers, and fostering a safe driving culture can further reduce collision risk. The data used in this paper can be found on the Toronto Open Data Portal.
